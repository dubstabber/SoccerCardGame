                <ol>
                    <li>You and the AI take turns playing cards - either attacking or defending.</li>
                    <li>When it's your turn to attack, select an attack card from your hand (bottom of screen).</li>
                    <li>When it's your turn to defend, select a goal card that matches the color of the AI's attack.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cards played are shown in the center of the board.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="how-to-section">
                <h4>Scoring Points</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>To score a goal:</strong> Play an attack card when the AI can't defend with a matching
                        color goal card.</li>
                    <li><strong>To prevent the AI from scoring:</strong> Play a goal card with the same color as the
                        AI's attack card.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The score is displayed at the top of the game board, with your score on the left.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Pay attention to which cards the AI has already played to predict if
                they can defend against certain colors!</p>
