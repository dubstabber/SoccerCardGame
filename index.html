                <p>You play with the cards at the bottom of the screen.</p>
                <p>There are two types of them: attacking card and defending card.</p>
                <p>Each type has 5 different colors: black, blue, brown, red and yellow.</p>
                <p>In order to score a point you have to click on an attacking card with the desired color.</p>
                <p>If AI has the defending card in its deck with the same color the player used to attack then no point is scored.</p>
                <p>Selected cards are being shown on the center.</p>
                <p>The turns are alternating so if you were an attacker then next time you probably are going to prepare for defending.</p>
                <p>You have to use an appropriate defending card in order to prevent AI from scoring.</p>
                <p>Your points are on the left of the Score bar.</p>
